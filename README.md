## What I Learned

ðŸ§  This project taught me valuable lessons, including:

- How to project 2D coordinates in a way that simulates a 3D environment.
- Techniques for managing object lighting.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lakshya-Coder/Fusion-of-3d-donut-and-cube
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd Fusion-of-3d-donut-and-cube
    ```
4. Compile and run the code:
     ```bash
      gcc -lm donut_with_cube.c && ./a.out 
     ```

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! ðŸŒŸ
